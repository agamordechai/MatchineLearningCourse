    "#### Concept\n",
    "LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based \n",
    "learning algorithms. It is designed to be efficient and scalable, offering faster training speeds \n",
    "and higher efficiency compared to other gradient boosting algorithms. \n",
    "LightGBM handles large-scale data and offers better accuracy while consuming less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of LightGBM\n",
    "1. Leaf-Wise Tree Growth: Unlike level-wise growth used by other algorithms, \n",
    "   LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise, focusing on the leaves with the maximum loss reduction.\n",
    "2. Histogram-Based Decision Tree: Uses a histogram-based algorithm to speed up training and reduce memory usage.\n",
    "3. Categorical Feature Support: Efficiently handles categorical features without needing to preprocess them.\n",
    "4. Optimal Split for Missing Values: Automatically handles missing values and determines the optimal split for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps\n",
    "1. Define the Objective Function: The loss function to be minimized.\n",
    "2. Compute Gradients: Calculate the gradients of the loss function.\n",
    "3. Fit the Trees: Train decision trees to predict the gradients.\n",
    "4. Update the Model: Combine the predictions of all trees to make the final prediction.\n"
