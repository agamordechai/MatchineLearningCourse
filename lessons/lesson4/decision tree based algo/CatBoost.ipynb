    "#### Concept: \n",
    "CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is a gradient boosting library that is particularly effective for datasets that include categorical features. It is designed to handle categorical data natively without the need for extensive preprocessing, such as one-hot encoding, which can lead to better performance and ease of use. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features of CatBoost\n",
    "1. Handling Categorical Features: Uses ordered boosting and a special technique to handle categorical features without needing preprocessing.\n",
    "2. Ordered Boosting: A technique to reduce overfitting by processing data in a specific order.\n",
    "3. Symmetric Trees: Ensures efficient memory usage and faster predictions by growing trees symmetrically.\n",
    "4. Robust to Overfitting: Incorporates techniques to minimize overfitting, making it suitable for various types of data.\n",
    "5. Efficient GPU Training: Supports fast training on GPU, which can significantly reduce training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps\n",
    "1. Define the Objective Function: The loss function to be minimized.\n",
    "2. Compute Gradients: Calculate the gradients of the loss function.\n",
    "3. Fit the Trees: Train decision trees to predict the gradients.\n",
    "4. Update the Model: Combine the predictions of all trees to make the final prediction.\n"
