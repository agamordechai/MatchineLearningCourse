    "#### Concept: \n",
    "Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic algorithms based on Bayes' Theorem with the \"naive\" assumption of independence between every pair of features. Despite this strong assumption, Naive Bayes classifiers have performed surprisingly well in many real-world applications, particularly for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes that the features follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "2. Multinomial Naive Bayes: Typically used for discrete data (e.g., text classification with word counts).\n",
    "3. Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Used for binary/boolean features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example using Python and its libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset that records features of different emails, such as word frequencies, to classify them as spam or not spam.\n",
